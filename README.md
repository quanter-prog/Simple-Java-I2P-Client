# Simple-Java-I2P-Client
#### Sample client application for I2P networking with the [I2P library](https://i2pgit.org/idk/i2p.i2p)

First of all, you need to have runnng **I2P router**.

In this example, the default settings (`127.0.0.1:7654`) are used because the router was running locally.

To change the default settings and connect to a remote router, use the configuration settings from the [official documentation](https://geti2p.net/en/docs/protocol/i2cp).

To run the router locally, use the application from the [official website](https://geti2p.com/en/).
